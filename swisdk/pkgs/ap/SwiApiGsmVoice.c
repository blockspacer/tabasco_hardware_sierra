 * \note Over-dial digits are numbers that are dialed after a circuit-switched 
 *       call has been established to communicate with a voice messaging system 
 *       or a PBX (for example, to enter a credit card number).  If your 
 *       application has a phone book feature, entries in the phone book may 
 *       contain over-dial digits separated from the main calling number
 *       by the "DTMF Control Digit Separator" (a comma). For example, 
 *       there might be a phone book entry, '6045551234,201,8'. This includes
 *       a component, ',201,8' to be over-dialed after the call is established. 
 *       The first comma separates the over-dial digits from the main number. 
 *       The second comma generates a three-second pause between dialing the 
 *       '201' and the '8'. In this example, you would use the function, 
 *       SwiSetCallOriginate to dial the phone number ('6045551234'). Once the 
 *       call is established, use SwiSetDTMFSend to send the '201,8'. (The 
 *       first comma should not be sent by either function.) The maximum number of 
 *       digits that can be sent with this function is 20.
