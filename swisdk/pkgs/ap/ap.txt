 * Name:  AP Package User Information
 * 
 * Purpose: The AP package contains all the code that implements the APIs
            and underlying management software for the Linux V2 SDK. The
 *          package is split up into several different types of code in
 *          one flat directory structure. 
 *          
 *          This description is a work in progress and will be updated as
 *          the AP package becomes better defined.
 *          
 * Entry Points:
 *          Refer to external customer documentation for the APIs supported
 *          by this package.
 *
 * Testing: Testing is done by running the executable appropriate for the 
 *          hardware being tested. For instance, on a 32-bit i386, run
 *          aptesti386. 
 * 
 *          More information required here when the test engine is more
 *          clearly defined
 *          
 * Limitations:
 *          None
 *          
 *          
 * NOTE:    
 *

 * contains test facilities and some internal functions for managing the
 * API-side during runtime
