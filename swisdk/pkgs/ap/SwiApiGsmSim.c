/**
 *
 * This function is used to enter a SIM requested code.
 * 
 * SIM API functions can not be called until a SWI_NOTIFY_SimsStatusExp
 * notification is received.  This indicates that the SIM is ready to 
 * process user requests.
 *
 * The SIM can request the user to enter any one of the following four codes:  
 * CHV1, CHV2, unblocking CHV1 and unblocking CHV2.  The SIM uses this to 
 * verify the identify of the user.  This function allows the caller to pass 
 * the user entered code to the SIM on the modem.  A request containing the 
 * code is sent to the modem.  The modem will respond to the request to 
 * indicate that the code is being verified by the SIM.  The result of the SIM
 * verification will be reflected in the SWI_NOTIFY_SimStatusExp notification.
 *            
 * If three failures in entering a correct CHV1 or CHV2 occur, this 
 * notification shows that the SIM has become blocked (CHV1) or the CHV2
 * features have become blocked.
 *
 * GSM standards designate 10 as the number of permitted attempts at correctly
 * entering PUK codes. This number is SIM dependent and carriers do not 
 * necessarily adhere to this standard.  If 10 failures in entering the PUK 
 * occur, this notification shows the SIM has become permanently blocked or 
 * the CHV2 features have become permanently blocked.
 *
 * \param      pSim: [IN]    
 *                     SIM requested code.
 *
 * \param      timeout: [IN]        
 *                     Response timeout value in milliseconds
 *
 * \return     SWI_RCODE_OK:
 *                     The request has been processed.  
 *                     The SWI_NOTIFY_SimStatusExp notification indicates 
 *                     whether the designated code matched.  It also shows 
 *                     the number of attempts at entering the code correctly.
