 * timeout applied by the api side whenever it calls
 * icapi_rcv(). It is added to the application's 
 * specified timeout on API calls, while the caller's 
 * timeout is used directly by the SDK when it is 
 * awaiting a response from the modem for a CnS Get/
 * Set/etc. operation. This ensure that the modem
 * timeout will always happen first. If the icapi_rcv()
 * times out, then this is some kind of system failure,
