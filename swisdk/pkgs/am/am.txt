 *
 * Name:  AM Package User Information
 * 
 * Purpose: The AM package contains code for the application messaging
 *          interface which sends and receives packets between the 
 *          Linux V2 SDK and an application. Packet definitions 
 *          contained in IDD_ApplicationMessaging.doc (and its sub-
 *          ordinate documents) are implemented within this package
 *
 *          Source files are split into multiple types, those processed
 *          within the SDK process and those processed by applications.
 *          The filename_sdk.c files are for use within the SDK process.
 *          
 * Entry Points:
 *          The AM package provides the following global entry points:
 *             hpTxPacket()   - See hptx.c for details
 *          
 * Testing: The test program contains a dummy AMCNSREQUEST packet header
 *          and simply passes this structure into the AM entry points
 *          for parsing the entries and advancing the packet pointer. 
 *          
 *          The test verification consists of observing the information
 *          information printed on the screen and comparing it with what
 *          is stored in the dummy packet. 
 *          
 * Limitations:
 *          None
 *          
 * NOTE:    
 *
