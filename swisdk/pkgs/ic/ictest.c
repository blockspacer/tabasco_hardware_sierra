 *
 *  Filename: ictest.c
 *
 *  Purpose:  Contains code to test the IC package
 *
 * Copyright: Â© 2008 Sierra Wireless, Inc., all rights reserved
 *
 * Note:      This file contains code that tests the IC package.
 *            The test is simple: create 2 threads, have each 
 *            thread send the other a message while the other 
 *            waits for it. Thread 1 sends first while thread 2
 *            listens, then they swap. The two threads output 
 *            their status to a log file in /var/log/xxx, where
 *            xxx depends upon the Distro of Linux you are using. 
 *            For Ubuntu, xxx is user.log. 
 *
 *            When you dump the log you should see alternating 
 *            reports from each thread. Thread 2 should report
 *            first then thread1. This repeats until the main()
 *            for loop times out on the waiter.
 *
 *            If you ^C or signal the program from a shell, you
 *            will see an abort in the log as well. This is normal
 *            behaviour.
 *
 *            At the moment this tests only the SMT mechanism, not
 *            the IPC mechanism that is also part of this package
 *
 *            If you don't touch the times in the IC calls in the
 *            threadx loops, you should see successive logs from 
 *            each thread every 4 seconds.
