 *
 * Notes:   To be called during SDK startup from the "main"
 *          entry point.
 *
 *          Initialization performed within each "xxinit()" call is
 *          limited to setting up internal structures within the
 *          package itself. It is not permitted that one package
 *          call into another to use its services during this phase
 *          of system initialization. However, it is permissible to
 *          make calls into the OS package for memory allocation,
 *          logging, etc. It is assumed that the OS Wrapper is fully
 *          initialized and ready to offer its services to outside
 *          callers.
 *
 *          This function is split into two parts, individual package
 *          initialization is first, followed by creation of tasks.
 *          Task creation should only be started after all package
 *          initialization routines have been called.
 *
 *          Task creation is serialized too, meaning that only one 
 *          task initialization function appears in part 2, below.
 *          When it is done starting, it calls sutaskinitcb(), above,
 *          which launches the next task in the sequence. This way,
 *          tasks are started in a controlled order
